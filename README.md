## What is the aim of this project?

In this project, we used the pandas library to analyze a dataset from Netflix, aiming to support strategic decision-making on content release strategies based on data insights. 
Our primary objective was to answer the question: Based on the analyzed data, what release strategy should we follow?

## Why this project is useful?

By examining patterns in content distribution, popularity across genres, and regional preferences, we gained valuable insights into which content resonates most with audiences in different countries. This analysis serves as a foundation for shaping Netflixâ€™s content strategy, helping to identify where new releases could generate the greatest engagement and impact.

## Dataset

For this project, the following repo uses data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

- Also, it contains code for the analysis (file called principal.ipynb).
- Finally, it contains the presentation slides (Project1-Netflix.pdf), where the key findings are visible.
